# instructions:
1) first install pytorch following directions here: http://pytorch.org/ <br>
2) install visdom: run <code>pip install visdom</code><br>
3) run <code>python -m visdom.server</code><br>
4) run <code>python main.py</code><br>


Initial runs were trying to tune hyper parameters for very small dataset we have

## experiment 1

adjusted learning rate function (which definitely helped smoothen loss curve but it is still rough); will keep the functionality as it may come in handy later on

# experiment 2

Raising epoch num obviously helps convergence and lowers overall loss, but overfitting is something to be aware of with such a small dataset

# experiment 3

Epoch num = 20; learning rate 0.0001;
Loss is lower and seems to be generally going down but necessarily converging;
Will now check accuracy scores to see if accuracy is generally improving

AT THIS POINT I ADDED ACCURACY TRACKING

# experiment 4

LOWER learning rate, 20 epochs. accuracy does not seem to go generally up or down. 

# experiment 5
learning_rate = 0.01
epoch_num = 20

# experiment 6
learninh_rate = 0.001
epoch_num = 30

# experiment 7
added validation loss to make sure overfitting is not happening

# experiment 8
added random rotation (data augmentation)

# experiment 9
added extra linear + dropout

# experiment 10
added different accuracy tracking

# experiment 11 
best model so far (experiment 6) with the accuracy tracking

# experiment 12
checked accuracy tracking again

# experiment 13
re added data augmentation that was removed in exp 11 to see if accuracy can go even higher
